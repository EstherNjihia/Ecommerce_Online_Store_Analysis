## Problem Statement
our e-coommerce business is growing fast and we are facing a challenge to understand the customers behavior and engagement and purchasing behavior. We are trying to find the best way to analyze the customer behavior and engagement and purchasing behavior.

## Project goals
1. Segment the customers based on their purchaing behavior.

## Resources used
Data Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail
Programming Language: Python
Analysis Techniques: RFM(Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

## Analysis Process
1. Data Preparation

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
Clean the data (handle missing values, convert data types)
Calculate basic metrics.

2. Customer Engagement Metrics

Calculate Recency (time since last purchase)
Calculate Frequency (number of purchases)
Calculate Monetary value (total amount spent)

3. RFM Analysis

Assign RFM scores to each customer
Segment customers based on their RFM scores

4. Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyze customer segment distribution
Examine relationships between Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value
Study monthly revenue trends
Identify top-selling products

5. Visualization

Create visualizations to illustrate key findings:

Customer segment distribution
Recency vs Frequency scatter plot
Average Monetary value by segment
Monthly revenue trend
